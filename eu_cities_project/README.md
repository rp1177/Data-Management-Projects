# European Cities Temperature Data Analysis Project

### Project Description
This project is focused on analyzing, cleaning, and manipulating temperature data for European cities. The data is stored in a CSV file and is processed using the Pandas DataFrame and Matplotlib libraries in Python. The goal of the project is to gain insights from the data through various data analysis techniques.

### Live Demo
A live demo of the project is not currently available.

### How to Build and Run
To run this project, follow these steps:
1. Download the CSV file containing the temperature data.
2. Open the Python Notebook file in your Python environment.
3. Execute the Python file (run all cells).

The program will process the input file and perform various data analysis tasks, including data cleaning and manipulation.

### Tech Used
The project is developed using Python (Jupyter Notebook), with the Pandas DataFrame and Matplotlib libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

### Development Process and Challenges
The development process involved understanding and implementing various data analysis techniques using the Pandas DataFrame and Matplotlib libraries. The main challenge encountered was dealing with the complexity of the temperature data and ensuring accurate data cleaning and manipulation. Despite these challenges, the project successfully analyzes the data and provides valuable insights.

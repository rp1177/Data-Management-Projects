# Movie Recommendation System Project (Prototype/Basic version)

### Project Description
This project is focused on developing a prototype movie recommendation system using Python. The system uses two input files: a ratings file and a movies file. The goal of the project is to use Python dictionaries to solve various problems related to movie recommendations, such as:

- Calculating average movie ratings
- Identifying popular movies
- Recommending new movies based on previous users' ratings on certain movie genres

The project does not rely on any external libraries for data manipulation, instead, it uses built-in Python features and functions, specifically Python dictionaries.

### Live Demo
A live demo of the project is not currently available.

### How to Build and Run
To run this project, follow these steps:
1. Download the text files (ratings and movies) and the Python (`*.py`) file.
2. Open the Python file in your Python environment.
3. Execute the Python file.

The program will process the input files and generate movie recommendations based on the data.

### Tech Used
The project is developed using Python. It does not rely on any external libraries for data manipulation, instead, it uses Python dictionaries.

### Development Process and Challenges
The development process involved understanding and implementing various data manipulation techniques in Python without the use of external libraries. This approach was chosen to gain a deeper understanding of how data manipulation can be performed at a lower level using Python dictionaries. The main challenge encountered was dealing with the complexity of movie ratings data and determining appropriate recommendation algorithms. Despite these challenges, the project successfully generates movie recommendations based on the input data.

# Data Management Projects

These projects represent my foundational understanding of the Python language and learn key data management skills. Each folder is a project that includes READMEs describing each project.

## Language Used:
**Python**

## Libraries Used:
- **CSV**: A module for Python used for reading and writing comma-separated values (CSV) files.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation library for Python. It provides data structures and functions needed to manipulate structured data.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for Python. It provides a way to visually display data.

## Key learning skills:

1.) Understand and utilize the basic data structures involved in Python.
2.) Learn fundamental data cleaning processes such as dealing with null values and removing outliers/duplicates. (CSV & Pandas DataFrame)
3.) To gain extra information, perform feature engineering from columns with existing information. 
4.) Create and analyze readable graphs that illustrate crucial information and conclusions about data. (Pandas)
5.) Demonstrate basic natural language processing skills (stemming, lemmatization, removing stopwords) without using the NLP library/sci-kit learn.

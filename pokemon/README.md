# Pokemon CSV Data Manipulation Project

### Project Description
This project is focused on demonstrating how to manipulate data in CSV files without using the Pandas library. The techniques used in this project include:

- Replacing missing or null values with averages based on attributes such as pokemon type, level, etc.
- Rounding certain values
- Sorting values in a specific order and extracting them into a separate text file
- Creating a new CSV file based on changes made to an original CSV file with missing values and information

The purpose of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of data manipulation techniques in Python.

### Live Demo
A live demo of the project is not currently available.

### How to Build and Run
To run this project, follow these steps:
1. Download the dataset and the notebook file.
2. Open the notebook file in your Python environment.
3. Click "run all cells" to execute the code.

The program will generate a new output file with corrected and filled data based on the manipulations performed on the original dataset.

### Tech Used
The project is developed using Python (Jupyter Notebook). It does not rely on the Pandas library for data manipulation, instead, it uses built-in Python features and functions, as well as the CSV library.

### Development Process and Challenges
The development process involved understanding and implementing various data manipulation techniques in Python without the use of the Pandas library. This approach was chosen to gain a deeper understanding of how data manipulation can be performed at a lower level. The main challenge encountered was dealing with missing or null values in the dataset and determining appropriate replacement values based on other attributes in the data. Despite these challenges, the project successfully manipulates the data and generates a new CSV file with the corrected and filled data.

The purpose of this project is to understand how to update/manipulate CSV file data without using the Pandas library. The data manipulation techniques
that are demonstrated in this project include:

  1.) Replacing missing or null values with averages based on pokemon type, level, etc.
  2.) Rounding certain values
  3.) Sorting values in certain order and extracting them into a separate text file
  4.) Creating a new CSV file based on changes being made to an original CSV file with missing values and information
